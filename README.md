# BrownShare2.0


A ride sharing website that allows you to share Uber/Lyft rides ahead of time with people within a 15 mile radius. This allows for rides to both be cheaper, and efficiently using these transportation methods. 
It would be ideal for those who are tight money, ideally a college student wanting to share a ride with someone going to the same destination at the same time as them. It would solve alot of problems that don't need to be as stressful as they are.
